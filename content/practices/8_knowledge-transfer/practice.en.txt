# Urban Development
The mission is to involve seniors in the local development.
We worked on a creative project about the town Dale i Sunnfjord and closed municipalities in Norway as an environmental case study. Together with the municipality and elders, we took part to the creative process to empathise physical exchange zones where elders contribute to the collectivity. In case of new urban spaces, the municipality have been the partner to apply new scenarios conclusions into reality. During this process, Olav Hovland, Norwegian architect, was the consultant for us, as he was already involved in former town development projects and research programs.

The results of the urban development include emotional and climatic qualities of the town, as well as aspects
of citizen movements. These results are included in a public lighting design for the town and in a structural
perspective for a future development. Prototypes of the public lighting have been produced and presented to the public during the 2010 design Biennial of Saint Etienne in France and in Norway.

# Knowledge transfer
The mission is to increase knowledge transfers between generations
We explored and studied the different ways to reintroduce the seniorsâ€˜ knowledge and the competences. Together with the participating elders, the studio linked the knowledge with contemporary design and material aspects. Resulting out of the knowledge transfer, prototypes have been realised and tuned with experts with urban lighting, sustainable and ecological friendly materials.
