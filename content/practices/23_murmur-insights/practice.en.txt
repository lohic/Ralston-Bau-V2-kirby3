Description:

Beginning 2017, we tested the first ideas of the MurMur with simple models in co-working spaces in Oslo and Marseille. Out of the observations and feedbacks we discovered three major insights:
Living modular rooms give the experience of a new space.
Nature and randomness brings life and value to rooms.
Visual confidentiality and echo sound-absorption provide a needed privacy in open spaces.
