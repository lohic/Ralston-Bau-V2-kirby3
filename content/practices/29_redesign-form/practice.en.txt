Description: During a Redesign Summer Camp, Ralston Bau made new redesign products with the inspiring objects of (link: https://www.fretex.no/ text: Fretex), the Norwegian salvation Army. The results, for the first time, are a complete handmade series: “Tekannelamper”(tea pot lights) and “Ståltrådlysestaker” (steel wire candle holder). Just launched, the series has got a lot of national and international attention already, through (link: http://davidreport.com/?s=ralston+bau text: David Report), NordicDesignBlog, DesignSpotter and others. Our studio was chosen to display products from their redesign series, made in collaboration with Fretex, within the exhibition “Brukbart” in the KODE Museum Bergen, Norway.
