Text: The D/S tables and chairs were especially designed and manufactured for D/S Ekspedisjonen, an old warehouse that was transformed into comfortable tourist apartments for rent in Dale in Sunnfjord on the west coast of Norway. Both chairs and tables are produced in massive oak. They are divided by a strip of sikaflex, which is inspired by the deck of a ship. D/S Table and Chair were awarded the Norsk Form best furniture prize 2005.
