During our Redesign Summer Camp, Ralston & Bau made new redesign products with the inspiring objects of Fretex. The results, for the first time, are a complete handmade series: “Tekannelamper”(tea pot lights) and “Ståltrådlysestaker” (steel wire candle holder). Just launched, the series has got a lot of national and international attention already – through NotCot, (link: http://davidreport.com/?s=ralston+bau text: David Report), NordicDesignBlog, DesignSpotter and others. Transplant was chosen to display products from their redesign series, made in collaboration with Fretex, within the exhibition “Brukbart” in the Permanenten West Norway Museum Bergen/ Norway.
