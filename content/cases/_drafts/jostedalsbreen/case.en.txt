Modular signage system for tourist information about continental Europe’s largest glacier and Norwegian National Park. Totem and information modules are placed on twenty seven information spots around the park. The modules are fixed to the surface of the terrain with a concrete and wood structure. This structure is then covered with natural materials sourced from the surrounding area to create a natural look, as if the modules have grown from the ground. The modules provide information regarding the surrounding area, and the closer to the glacier, the more specific the information becomes about the glacier. The main material of the modules is a mix of granulated plastic that is 100% recyclable. The blue semi-transparent colour is custom made for this project and called “ice blue”. It was designed by Durat for Ralston & Bau.
