Title: The Other Side

----

Text: The concept development and design of this former East Finmark caravan park has transformed it into an internationally acclaimed luxury resort and the first Norwegian member of Design Hotels. The Other Side is inspired by the local Sami culture, the sport of dog mushing and the ornamental richness of nearby Russia. The world of the owners was of great inspiration to the concept of The Other Side. They are both experienced adventurers and dog mushers. Twelve Element Houses are positioned in groups of three, providing private housing. Each are designed following the basic elements of the Sami culture: earth, wind, fire and water.
