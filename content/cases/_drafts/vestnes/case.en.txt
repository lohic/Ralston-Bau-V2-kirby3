Text: The ocean is the natural environment for modern ships outfitted with the Willy Furniture Collection and Maritime Interior Collection made by Vestnes, who have now brought their knowledge into the office environment with room solutions and furniture adapted to human work spaces on land. Vestnes Ocean has succeeded to enter the international market, with their own furniture range “Willy” designed by Ralston & Bau, since the company is grabbing market shares and doubling it’s revenues, despite a cyclic maritime market. Ralston & Bau designed the fair stand at NorShipping several years for the company.
