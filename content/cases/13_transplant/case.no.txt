Text: On our way to live in California, we had a pit stop on the west coast of Norway for few months in an art residency. After reflecting, we did not want this experience to stop and started to draft scenarios that would enable us to stay there, in a village beside a fjord. Life is truly full of surprises. We lived there for 15 years.
