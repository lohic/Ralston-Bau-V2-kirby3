“Sous les Cerisiers” (under the cherry trees) is an invitation to taste the delicious cooking of Sakura. This intimate restaurant in Paris is dedicated to a balanced fusion of Japanese and French gastronomy. A deep theatrical influence on the surroundings, typical in Japan and France, can be seen through the scenographic layers, costumes and shadows cast throughout the interior. A contrast of dark and light divides the room into two parts: a bright space, with the bar as a center point, is used for cooking courses during the daytime, and a dark section reinforcing the perspective, where guests are placed to enjoy a gastronomic menu at night. Moveable translucent walls separate the seating areas for privacy. Sous les Cerisiers is selected by Wallpaper magazine and published in the(link: https://fr.phaidon.com/store/travel/wallpaper-city-guide-paris-9780714876498/ text:  Wallpaper City Guide Paris) edition.
