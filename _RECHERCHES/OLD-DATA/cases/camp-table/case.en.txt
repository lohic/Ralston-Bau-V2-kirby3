When we created the Camp Tables we wanted to keep the design honest, like the traditional outdoors camp tables collaborated with the old trunks tied together on-site. The Camp Tables are made from salvaged old construction materials with the original thicknesses conserved. The passage of time and use is still visible on the table tops. The Camp Space Table is a dining table that defines its own space in the room. The looming structure built up in the air is able to give a larger presence to the actual size of the table within the room. The upper horizontal beam is an integrative part of the design. Solutions that are being developed are a quilted curtain and hanging lighting to be attached to the beam. This means that the table can be transformed into an intimate workspace by simply adjusting the quilted curtain to protect the space visually and from sounds.
