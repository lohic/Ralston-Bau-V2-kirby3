“Hover Wall” is a graphic design applied to an existing paper-Wall ‘Pipe Drop’  from Les Procédés Chenel International. The paper wall can be used to form small rooms or to separate a room into several parts. The paper wall is produced in a “honeycomb” structure which gives it properties that enables flexible use and free standing stability. The “HoverWall” design plays with visual deception and gives the impression of being a floating wall, or the perceiver being in a floating room.
