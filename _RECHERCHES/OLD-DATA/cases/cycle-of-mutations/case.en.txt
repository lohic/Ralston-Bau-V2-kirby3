The Cycle of Mutation” was a cycle of evolution that represented the cycle of life. The cycle contained four themes under which Transplant mutated - “Emergence”, “Growth”, “Maturation” and “Disappearance”. Each theme lasted for six months and influenced every- thing which happened in Transplant during that time such as exhibitions, the design shop, concerts and other events. The main objective of Transplant is to develop a platform for an international creative scene.
Through this platform Transplant has brought people together across national borders, experimented and developed with them new ideas and boosted the dialog between creatives and manufacturers - a platform to think, discuss and produce. The ideas generated, works and products of the Transplant community have been discussed and exhibited in Transplant itself and beyond.
